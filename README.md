# LearnMandarinReactNativeExpo

A React Native App that helps you learn Mandarin Chinese Simple and Traditional characters, their Pinyin, and their English meanings.

Used nested Animated ScrollViews to allow the user swipe up or down to hide or show answers while they swipe left and right to move forward and backward through the translations of a specific character and/or to move forward and backward through the ordered list of characters themselves
